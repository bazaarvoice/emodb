/**
 * Result returned from {@link Databus#poll(String, Duration, int)}.  The result contains to attributes:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         The an iterator of {@link Event} instances returned from the poll, returned by {@link #getEventIterator()}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         A boolean indicator for whether there are more events and the caller would benefit from immediately re-polling
 *         versus delaying for a brief period before polling again.  Because the databus discards redundant events it's
 *         possible that it will return less than the requested number of events even though the queue is not empty.
 *         In an extreme example if the queue is deep and contains nothing but redundant events then the poll result may
 *         contain no events yet still indicate that there are more events.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * As a convenience the result has a {@link #getEvents()} method which returns all of the events from the stream in a
 * list.  This is present primarily to support older non-streaming implementations and may be removed in a future
 * release.
