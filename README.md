Introduction
------------

EmoDB is a RESTful HTTP server for storing JSON objects and for watching for changes
to those events.

It is designed to span multiple data centers, using eventual consistency (AP) and multi-master
conflict resolution.  It relies on [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) for
persistence and cross-data center replication.
