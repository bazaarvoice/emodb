/**
 * Wrapper around the json table storage metadata for a specific table uuid.
 * <p>
 * Data for a table is stored in buckets called "storages" in the source code, where each "storage" has a
 * cluster-unique 64-bit uuid that's part of the row key prefix for every Cassandra row.
 * <p>
 * The hierarchy looks
 * something like:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *     A table contains one or more groups of "storage" objects.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Each storage in a group is a separate copy of the same set of data.
 *     <p>
 *     In the steady state, all storages in a particular group have identical copies of the data.  The only exception
 *     is when a new storage is first created and added to a group--its data set must be copied from one of the other
 *     storages before it matches the rest.
 *     <p>
 *     For live (non-dropped) tables there's always one group of storages for the master table data, the data you
 *     read&write with regular operations (see {@link TableJson#getMasterStorage()}).
 *     <p>
 *     There are zero or more groups of objects for facades, one group for each facade (see
 *     {@link TableJson#getFacades()}).
 *     <p>
 *     Dropped storage objects don't belong to a group (see @link TableJson#getStorage()} where
 *     {@code isDropped() == true}).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Within a group of storages there's always one storage that's designated the "primary".  The remainder are
 *     designated "mirrors".
 *     <p>
 *     The system tries to keep the primary and the mirrors in sync by writing every write
 *     to every mirror, so they all have exactly the same data at all times (except for writes in-flight).
 *     <p>
 *     Writers apply every update to the primary and to all mirrors.  In the steady state, this keeps all the
 *     storages in a group in sync so they always have the exact same data.  The only exception is immediately after
 *     a mirror is created where not all servers may know about the new mirror yet.  This is important because the
 *     system can't perform the initial background bulk-copy to seed a new mirror until it knows every server knows
 *     about the new mirror and is actively mirroring writes to it.
 *     <p>
 *     In general, readers always read from the primary.  The one exception is that the getSplits() call returns split
 *     identifiers that reference specific storage uuids, so the getSplit() method is allowed to read from mirrors
 *     as long as the mirror is consistent and has not expired.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Within each storage the data is sharded across a number of shards, designed to ensure that data is spread
 *     evenly across a Cassandra cluster that uses the ByteOrderedPartitioner.  See the "shards" and "shardsLog2"
 *     properties.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
