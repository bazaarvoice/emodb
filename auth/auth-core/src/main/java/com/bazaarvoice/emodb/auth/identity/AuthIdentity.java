    /**
     * Each identity is associated with an immutable ID distinct from the secret authentication key.  This is done
     * for several reasons:
     *
     * <ol>
     *     <li>
     *         Parts of the system may need associate resources with an ID.  For example, each databus subscription
     *         is associated with an API key.  By using a distinct  ID these parts of the system don't need to
     *         be concerned with safely storing the API key, since the ID is essentially a reference to the key.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         Parts of the system may need to determine whether an ID has permission to perform certain actions
     *         without actually logging the user in.  Databus fanout is a prime example of this.  Using IDs
     *         in the interface allows those parts of the system to validate authorization for permission without
     *         the ability to impersonate that user by logging them in.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         If an ID is compromised an administrator may want to replace it with a new ID without
     *         changing all internal references to that ID.
     *     </li>
     *     <li>
     *         User management can be performed without the identity owner divulging her authentication ID,
     *         such as over a chat client or in an email.
     *     </li>
     * </ol>
